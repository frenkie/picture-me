# picture-me
Pimp your party with a themed picture guestbook. Get your friends in front of the camera 
and get randomized photos to fit your heads (and body) in. Press the big button and voila, 
an instant guestbook memory!

## install
An `npm install` should do the trick.
Afterwards do `npm start` or `npm run debug` to run a server on 
[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## usage

You can use your mouse to interact with the site or the following keys:
-   A : Mimicks the big red button which has 3 phases: start camera mode, take a snapshot, save it
-   S : Save a snapshot
-   D : Delete a snapshot in camera mode
-   W : Exit camera mode
-   Right arrow : change frame

No browser feature detection is done, so for now you're save in the latest version of
Chrome.

## still some nice to haves
